    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Jeuan</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Jeuan, a passionate new web developer with a love for creating
      dynamic and engaging web applications. I am beginning to enjoy working
      with Django and building projects that solve real-world problems. When I'm
      not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies and continuously
      learning to improve my skills.I celebrated my 20th wedding anniversary
      last Friday, and I am a father of two sons. My eldest is 18 years old and
      a freshman at Lincoln University Mo majoring in Computer Information
      Systems, and my youngest is 16 and is a junior in high school and
      participates in the HS Marching band. Oh yes, I also love playing video
      games! My current mobile game obsession is "Kingshot" where I enjoy the
      strategic gameplay and competitive nature of the game. Yada yada yada...
